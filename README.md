Adidas is the page chosen to clone using VTEX IO technology, making a responsive design to the different views of the page.


Through the use of native vtex components, the adidas Store Theme allows users to access e-commerce functions by following a transactional flow:

1. Home page.
2. Department. (Product List Page (PLP)).
3. Category. (PLP).
4. Subcategory. (PLP).
5. Search (Vtex Intelligent search).
6. Mincart.
7. Product Details Page (PDP).
8. Checkout flow.
9. Checkout confirmation.
10. Custom pages.

### Step 1 -  Basic setup
Access the VTEX IO basic setup guide and follow all the given steps.
By the end of the setup, you should have the VTEX command line interface (Toolbelt) installed along with a developer workspace you can work in.

### Step 2 - Cloning Adidas Store Theme repository
Clone this template ‚Üê [https://github.com/Yesiblato/store-theme-adidas] repository to your local files to be able to effectively start working on it.
Then, access the repository's directory using your terminal.

### Step 3 - Editing the Manifest.json
Once in the repository directory, it is time to edit the Minimum Boilerplate manifest.json file.
Once you are in the file, you must replace the vendor and account values. vendor is the account name you are working on and account is anything you want to name your theme. For example:
json
```
{
  "vendor": "itgloberspartnercl",
  "name": "adidas-store-theme",
}
```
Also, check that the file has the following builders:
```
  "builders": {
    "assets": "0.x",
    "styles": "2.x",
    "store": "0.x",
    "docs": "0.x"
  },
```

### Step 4 - Installing required apps
In order to use Store Framework and work on your store theme, it is needed to have both vtex.store-sitemap and vtex.store installed.
Run  vtex list  and check whether those apps are already installed.
If they aren't, run the following command to install them: 
```
  vtex install 
  vtex.store-sitemap 
  vtex.store -f
```
### Step 5 - Uninstalling any existing theme
By running `vtex list`,  you can verify if any theme is installed.
It is common to already have a `vtex.store-theme`  installed when you start the store's front development process.

Therefore, if you find it in the app's list, copy its name and use it together with the command `vtex uninstall`. For example:
json
```
     vtex uninstall vtex.store-theme 
```
### Step 6- Run and preview your store
Then time has come to upload all the changes you made in your local files to the platform. For that, use the `vtex link` command.

If the process runs without any errors, the following message will be displayed: `App linked successfully`. 

Then, run the `vtex browse` command to open a browser window having your linked store in it.

This will enable you to see the applied changes in real time, through the account and workspace in which you are working.
